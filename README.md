#  :fire: UC-FIRe :fire: : Unsupervised, Cost-effective and Fast approach to Information Retrieval

## :fire: What is it ? 

UC-FIRe is an unsupervised model to perform Information Retrieval that does not need GPU and is almost as fast as BM25 at inference while outperforming it on several corpora.

For more information, checkout out our publication:

For the moment, the publication is under review at the 2025 ECML-PKDD Conference in the Applied Data-Science track. 

## :fire: How to use it ? 

- Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Limekaaa/UC-FIRe
```

- To reproduce the experiment on NFCorpus you can run the notebook main.ipynb as it is !
- To test different dataset from the [BEIR benchmark](https://github.com/beir-cellar) feel free to check out the corporas available and play with the parameters.
- You can also test it on your own corpus by loading it in the same format as the datasets present in BEIR.
